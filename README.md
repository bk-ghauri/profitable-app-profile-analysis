# Profitable App Profile Analysis

This project explores profitable mobile app profiles in the App Store and Google Play markets, using open-source datsets from Kaggle. The goal is to help a mobile app development company identify which types of apps are most likely to generate high user engagement, and therefore, greater ad revenue.

## 📊 Datasets

This project uses two publicly available datasets from Kaggle:

- [Google Play Store Apps](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps/data)
- [Mobile App Store ( 7200 apps)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps)
